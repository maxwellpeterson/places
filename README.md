# Places

Appreciating the small features of the places we live that make them special to us.

Developed by Max Peterson, Belle Lim, and Jueun Kang, with the support of Arun Jeevanantham and [Oasis](https://www.oasisneu.com/).

## Motivation

Platforms like Google Maps and Instagram boil down the perceived importance of locations around us to a few key metrics. But are places with thousands of reviews on Google or geotags on Instagram meaningful features of the city to the people that live there?

With a focus on flexible-form storytelling, the goal of Places is to recognize locations that have personal significance to the individuals that interact with them. These places probably donâ€™t show up a Google Maps, and might otherwise be overlooked by the casual passer-by. But regardless of their physical presence, they influence the lives of the people in our communities, and derive their meaning from this lived experience.

Places is a tool for understanding the human side of the built environment around us. For those close to home, it can give new meaning to places we may have passed by hundreds of times without ever thinking twice about. And to visitors in a foreign city, it can uncover the unique interactions that we may not be able to recognize as a cultural outsider. Both a geographical storytelling platform and an exploration of urban identity, Places encourages users to reflect on their own environment and appreciate the locations that impact others in their community.
